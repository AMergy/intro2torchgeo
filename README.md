# Women+ in Geospatial - Mentorship Program

This repository is the legacy project of the cohort #3 of the Mentorship Program W+iG (2022-2023).

It aims at showcasing how to leverage current Geospatial data science tools and transfer learning to perform land cover classification using limited resource usage. Potential applications include very different situations, such as the training of a deep learning model on-board a satellite but also being able to perform classification using remote sensing data with limited resource usage, for instance at home with a personal laptop which does not have a GPU.

One of the expected impacts of this project is to make coding and deep learning more accessible to the comunity, by presenting it in a clear, simple and concise way. 

Another expected impact is to gain an understanding of how to best perform transfer learning when resource usage is limited, through explainable AI.

# Study

This code was implemented and run on a system with the following characteristics:
- number of CPUs
```
CPU(s):                  8
```
- RAM
```
Mem:            15Gi
Swap:          2,0Gi
```

A choice was made to not use any GPU, to make sure this code can be run by any user on most systems, and to make sure satisfying results can be reached with limited resources. 

## Dataset

- The NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) dataset is a high-resolution aerial imagery dataset of the United States, with four spectral bands (R, G, B, IR). It can be used for various applications including land use classification, crop mapping, and object detection.

## Model

ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep, used for classification tasks.
